     <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
     <p> In IT-related branches, there is a good placement rate, but in core branches, placements are not much good. Even internship related companies are not available at that time. Top recruiting companies for IT-related branches are Amazon, Flipkart, etc. For core branches, Hero, Honda, Mahindra, etc., visit here for placements. The highest salary package offered in 2020 was 21 LPA,
 and the average salary package offered was 6 LPA. For internships, approximately 10% of the students got selected.Placements in our college are very good. Nearly 85% of the students from our batch got placed. The highest salary package offered for our course is 22 LPA. The lowest salary package offered is 3 LPA, and the average salary
 package offered is around 7.5 LPA. Top recruiting companies of our college are Ford, Bajaj, Samsung etc. Placements are quite good here. Most of the students will get jobs in good companies. But the problem is that about 50% of the students from core branches like mechanical, civil, ECE and electrical have to opt for non-core jobs. 
CS/IT students get a lot of opportunities than other branches. Almost 80% of the students from CS/IT got placed within the first two months of the 4th year. 
Getting a salary package of 10 LPA in CS/IT is quite easy.
